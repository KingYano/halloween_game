"Halloween_game" is an online game project, a simple racing game where the player controls a ghost that must avoid obstacles such as pumpkins and tombstones. The game increases in speed and difficulty over time.

The basic visuals were sourced from @Bedimcode, and the game visuals were generated by the artificial intelligence DALLÂ·E 3.
